The code you have provided is a Python script that connects to a MySQL database. The script uses the `decouple` library to read environment variables from a `.env` file. The `.env` file contains the following variables:

* `MYSQL_USER`: The username for the MySQL database.
* `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: The password for the MySQL database.
* `MYSQL_HOST`: The host name for the MySQL database.
* `MYSQL_DB`: The name of the MySQL database.
* `MYSQL_PORT`: The port number for the MySQL database.

The script first imports the `decouple` library. Then, it reads the environment variables from the `.env` file. Next, it imports the `mysql.connector` library. Then, it connects to the MySQL database using the `connect()` method. The `connect()` method takes the following parameters:

* `user`: The username for the MySQL database.
* `password`: The password for the MySQL database.
* `host`: The host name for the MySQL database.
* `db`: The name of the MySQL database.
* `port`: The port number for the MySQL database.

Once the connection is established, the script prints a message to the console indicating that the connection was successful. The script then executes a `show databases` query to list all of the databases in the MySQL database. Finally, the script closes the connection to the MySQL database.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The `decouple` library is imported.
2. The environment variables are read from the `.env` file.
3. The `mysql.connector` library is imported.
4. The `connect()` method is used to connect to the MySQL database.
5. A message is printed to the console indicating that the connection was successful.
6. A `show databases` query is executed to list all of the databases in the MySQL database.
7. The connection to the MySQL database is closed.

I hope this helps!
