The code you have provided is for connecting to a MySQL database and querying the database.

The first step is to import the necessary libraries. In this case, we need to import the `decouple` library, which is used to read environment variables, and the `mysql.connector` library, which is used to connect to MySQL databases.

The next step is to define the connection parameters. These parameters include the username, password, host, database name, and port number.

Once the connection parameters have been defined, we can connect to the database. To do this, we use the `connect()` method of the `mysql.connector` library.

The `connect()` method takes the connection parameters as arguments. It returns a connection object, which we can use to execute queries.

To execute a query, we use the `execute()` method of the connection object. The `execute()` method takes the query as an argument.

The `execute()` method returns a cursor object, which we can use to iterate over the results of the query.

To iterate over the results of the query, we use the `fetchall()` method of the cursor object. The `fetchall()` method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row in the result set.

The following code shows how to connect to a MySQL database and query the database:

```python
import decouple
import mysql.connector

# Define the connection parameters.
user = decouple.config('MYSQL_USER')
password = decouple.config('MYSQL_PASSWORD')
host = decouple.config('MYSQL_HOST')
database = decouple.config('MYSQL_DB')
port = decouple.config('MYSQL_PORT')

# Connect to the database.
connection = mysql.connector.connect(user=user, password=password, host=host, database=database, port=port)

# Create a cursor object.
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Execute a query.
cursor.execute("SELECT name, countrycode FROM city")

# Iterate over the results of the query.
for name, countrycode in cursor.fetchall():
    print(name, "|", countrycode)

# Close the connection.
connection.close()
```

I hope this helps!
